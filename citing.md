## Academic Dishonesty 

* What is academic dishonesty?
* What happens if I get caught plagiarizing?
* Want to know more about the California State University, Channel Islands, policy on academic dishonesty?

The following is the California State University, Channel Islands policy on academic dishonesty found in the 2008-2009 Catalog:

> _Academic Dishonesty_
> 1.	Academic dishonesty includes such things as cheating, inventing false information or citations, plagiarism and helping someone else commit an act of academic dishonesty. It usually involves an attempt by a student to show possession of a level of knowledge or skill that he/she does not possess.
> 2.	Course instructors have the initial responsibility for detecting and dealing with academic dishonesty. Instructors who believe that an act of academic dishonesty has occurred are obligated to discuss the matter with the student(s) involved. Instructors should possess reasonable evidence of academic dishonesty. However, if circumstances prevent consultation with student(s), instructors may take whatever action (subject to student appeal) they deem appropriate.
> 3.	Instructors who are convinced by the evidence that a student is guilty of academic dishonesty shall assign an appropriate academic penalty. If the instructors believe that the academic dishonesty reflects on the student’s academic performance or the academic integrity in a course, the student’s grade should be adversely affected. Suggested guidelines for appropriate actions are: an oral reprimand in cases where there is reasonable doubt that the student knew his/her action constituted academic dishonesty; a failing grade on the particular paper, project or examination where the act of dishonesty was unpremeditated, or where there were significant mitigating circumstances; a failing grade in the course where the dishonesty was premeditated or planned. The instructors will file incident reports with the Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs and for Student Affairs or their designees. These reports shall include a description of the alleged incident of academic dishonesty, any relevant documentation, and any recommendations for action that he/she deems appropriate.
> 4.	The Vice President for Student Affairs shall maintain an Academic Dishonesty File of all cases of academic dishonesty with the appropriate documentation.
> 5.	Student may appeal any actions taken on charges of academic dishonesty to the “Academic Appeals Board.”
> 6.	The Academic Appeals Board shall consist of faculty and at least one student.
> 7.	Individuals may not participate as members of the Academic Appeals Board if they are participants in an appeal.
> 8.	The decision of the Academic Appeals Board will be forwarded to the President of CSU Channel Islands, whose decision is final.
