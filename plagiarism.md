# Plagiarism Quick-Guide

## Terms to Know

### Plagiarism

> Using other people’s words and ideas without clearly acknowledging the source of the information

### Common Knowledge

>Facts that can be found in numerous places and are likely to be widely known.

*Example:   John F. Kennedy was elected President of the United States in 1960. 
This is generally known information- You do not need to document this fact*

### Interpertation

> You must document facts that are not generally known, or ideas that interpret facts.

*Example: Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player ever to have played the game.  This idea is not a fact but an interpretation- You need to cite the source*

### Quotation 
> Using someone’s words directly.  When you use a quote, place the passage you are using in quotation marks, and document the source according to a standard documenting style.

*Example:  According to John Smith in The New York Times, “37% of all children under the age of 10 live below the poverty line”.*

## Strategies for Avoiding Plagiarism

* Submit your own work
* Put quotations around everything that comes directly from the text, especially when taking notes.
* Paraphrase, but be sure that you are not simply rearranging or replacing a few words
* Keep a source journal, notepad, note cards- annotated bibliographies can be especially beneficial
* Use the style manual assigned for the class
* Get help from the writing center or library
